# RSA-Project

This project will guide you through the steps of code breaking using RSA (named after the three inventor's initials.) You will be able to encode your own message, decode someone else's message, and crack the code of someone else's private keys. As you follow along, you will start with  an essential function named FME (Fast Modular Expression), which is an algorithm to prepare your message for encryption and decryption. You will use this function later on when you get to the encode and decode section. The Euclidean Algorithm function will be used to create your public key, and the extended euclidean algorithm will be used to create your private keys. These two pieces of information are crucial to the success of the process. Once you have this information, you can input them into the encode/decode functions to reveal or encode the secret messages. You will also learn about prime factorization in the RSA process, which will round out the knowledge needing for understanding cryptography. Once you have gone through all the functions individually, you will have the chance at the end to use the guided interaction to encode and decode your own messages easily. You can create new keys, encode your own message, and decode a message whether you know the private key or not.
